# important_algorithms

## Purpose of this repository

I'm on a journey: learn Java!

In this repository there are soma of the most important algorithms every programmer should know!
They can be used to learn how to solve a bunch of problems and they are a must have in every computer science student
set of skills.

## The structre

Each folder is a type of algorithm.

Inside each folder there will be a README.md that contains the info about the codes and what I've learned, such as
when to use it, how it works and more.

## Running the codes

I didn't build -- yet -- a little system where the user can run and interact with the code using the terminal. 
Instead I just used App.java class to create new instances of the classes listed above and passed values to the variables.

So, to run the codes, you can change the values on the classes' instances.

-- but I'll change this in the future if convenient --

## Remember

The codes are simple and perhaps not written in the best possible way due to my limited knowledge so far.

It's important to say that I intend to improve the codes posted, so I can upgrade them and see how I could do them in a
differente way, comparing each solution with a better version.
